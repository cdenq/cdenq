## About Me

👋 Hi! 

I’m Chris, and I'm majorly passionate about **data science**!

Why? Because I'm deeply fascinated with the study of patterns, particulary in service of problem-solving! To me, data science is one of most direct (and fun) domains through which I can use applied pattern-recognition to create meaningful, real-world impact. 🌎 

This GitHub documents my avid self-directed and project-focused journey into data science.

Feel free to reach out to me through any of my links!
