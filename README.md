I am a full-stack data scientist with interests in machine learning and user safety. On the...

- industry-side, I am excited about solving business challenges through machine learning (modeling, analytics, deployment)
- research-side, I am interested in optimizing machine learning models (compute/data efficiency, sampling)
- policy-side, I am interested in protecting users (privacy-invasion, bias, and abuse)

Overall, I'm most excited about opportunities that rest at these intersections and are aimed at world-positive impact. üåéü§ñ
  
Beyond my industry and academic interests, I'm an avid self-learner and board game enthusiast.
