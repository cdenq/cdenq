# Hello! üòÑ 
[![Website](https://img.shields.io/website?label=portfolio&style=for-the-badge&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcodestackr.com)](https://cdenq.github.io/)

My name is Christopher Denq, and I'm majorly passionate about solving problems with tech! I am particularly interested in the intersection between scalable code and predictive analytics (eg. machine learning engineering), and I have experience within **full-stack development** and **data science** alike. As an avid self-learner and serial project-builder, I am always looking to tackle tech-based challenges in effort to add value back into the world. üåé 

I have a post-bacc certificate in Data Science and a BA in Philosophy and Art History from the University of Pennsylvania (LPS'22, C'21). I am current taking college courses in mathematics and statistics in effort to better understand the underlying processes in machine learning.

Fun fact about me: I enjoy prototyping and playing board games! My favorite genre to design in is story-driven cooperative games, and my favorite to play is economy-and-combat driven strategy games (Kemet, Caverna, and Root).

Feel free to reach out to me through any of my links at the bottom of the page!
