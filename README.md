👋 Hi! I’m Chris, or @cdenq.
 
👀 I really love problem-solving as a sport!

♟️ Anything from math to machine learning, from riddles to escape rooms--it's all just applied pattern-recognition in service of problem-solving.

😊 Data science is something that deeply fasnscinates me because it takes this problem-solving to such a challenging (and fun!) level.
