# Hello! 😄 [![Website](https://img.shields.io/badge/My-Website-blue?style=flat-square&logo=appveyor)](https://cdenq.github.io/)

### 💻 I am a safety-conscious data scientist, boardgame enthusiast, and avid self-learner.

As an art history and philosophy major, I have always been passionate about discovering insights among messy data and ambiguous business problems. I pursued this passion as a painting specialist in the art market, where-in I was challenged daily with converting artistic data into quantitative business takeaways (eg. price evaluations).

Over time, my art analytics eventually led me to discover data science and machine learning, domains which offered tools more robust than any I was using in the art world. Instantly falling in love, I ultimately pivoted towards data science to pursue my original passion more fully. Using my passion for data-narratives, I hope to continue to contribute to community and world impact! 🌎
