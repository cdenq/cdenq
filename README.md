# Hello! 😄 [![Website](https://img.shields.io/badge/My-Website-blue?style=flat-square&logo=appveyor)](https://cdenq.github.io/)

### 💻 I'm passionate about data-driven narratives!

As an art history and philosophy major, I have always been passionate about discovering insights among messy and intangible data. Over time, my industry experience in the art market had led me to discover data science, a domain that was a natural fit for my passions and skillsets. Pivoting towards a career in data science, I am heavily motivated towards directing my engineering skills at community and world impact! 🌎

I am an avid self-learner and serial project builder. Please see my projects below as examples of my work!
