## About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hi! 

My name is Christopher Denq, and I'm majorly passionate about using data and tech to solve problems. I am particularly interested in the intersection between scalable code and predictive analytics (aka. machine learning engineering), and have ample experience within full-stack development and data science alike.

I have a post-bacc certificate in Data Science and a BA in Philosophy and Art History from the University of Pennsylvania (LPS'22, C'21).

Fun fact: before transitioning into tech, I interned heavily within the art specialty space (Christie's Auctions & Private Sales, Philadelphia Museum of Art). 

Feel free to reach out to me through any of my links.
