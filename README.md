## About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hi! 

Iâ€™m Chris, and I'm majorly passionate about **data science**!

Why? Because I'm deeply fascinated with the study of patterns, particulary in service of problem-solving! To me, data science is one of most direct (and fun) domains through which I can use applied pattern-recognition to create meaningful, real-world impact. ðŸŒŽ

## Currently

I'm a recent Penn graduate with a background in business analytics from Wharton and art speciality from CAS. Due to the rigidty of my dual-program, I was unable to shape my curriculum to match data science properly. As such, after finishing my Bachelors, I immediately went back to Penn for a more concentrated approach at my data science dreams.

These are some of the formal programs and self-guided learning experiences that I'm pursuing:

- ðŸ§ª [Winter Internship] California State University: Northridge | Machine Learning Assistant Researcher    
    - current, Nov '21 to early Jan '22

- ðŸŽ“ [Education] Penn Engineering/LPS | certificate in Data Analysis and Visualization
     - current, mid Sep '21 to mid Mar '22
