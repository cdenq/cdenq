## About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hi! 

Iâ€™m Chris, and I'm majorly passionate about **data science**!

Why? Because I'm deeply fascinated with the study of patterns, particulary in service of problem-solving! To me, data science is one of most direct (and fun) domains through which I can use applied pattern-recognition to create meaningful, real-world impact. ðŸŒŽ

I am leveling up my data science skills at Penn's Data Science program, graduating in March 2022. My undergraduate background is in business analytics and art speciality, also from Penn (C'21).
