## About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hi! 

Iâ€™m Chris, and I'm majorly passionate about **data science**!

Why? Because I'm deeply fascinated with the study of patterns, particulary in service of problem-solving!

I love anything from math (number patterns) to machine learning (modeling patterns), from Catan (resource patterns) to escape rooms (puzzle patterns). At the core of this fascination sits data science, one of the coolest domains through which applied pattern-recognition leads to forecasting, insights, and really neat narratives!

## Currently
I'm working towards enabling my data science dreams through a number of formal and self-guided learning experiences:

- ðŸ§ª [Winter Internship] California State University: Northridge | Machine Learning Assistant Researcher

- ðŸŽ“ [Certification] Penn Engineering/LPS | certificate in Data Analysis and Visualization

- ðŸŒ± [Self-Guided Course] Harvard University @ edX | Data Analysis in Life Sciences program

- ðŸŒ± [Self-Guided Course] Amazon AWS Courses | Machine Learning for Business Challenges

- ðŸ“˜ [Self-Guided Learning] __Statistical Learning, An Introduction to__ by James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani
