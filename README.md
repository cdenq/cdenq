# Hello! 😄 [![Website](https://img.shields.io/badge/My-Website-blue?style=flat-square&logo=appveyor)](https://cdenq.github.io/)

### 💻 I'm passionate about data-driven narratives!

As an art history and philosophy major, I have always been passionate about discovering insights among messy data and ambiguous business problems. I pursued this passion as a painting specialist in the art market, where-in I was challenged daily with converting artistic data into quantitative business takeaways (eg. price evaluations).

Over time, my art analytics eventually led me to discover data science and machine learning, domains which offered tools more robust than any I was using in the art world. Instantly falling in love, I ultimately pivoted towards data science to pursue my original passion more fully. As such, I am heavily motivated by data science as a means of improving my community and world impact! 🌎

I am an avid self-learner and serial project builder. Please see my projects below as examples of my work!
